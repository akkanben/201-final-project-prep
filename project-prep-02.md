## Project Idea #1

 Pitching a Project
1. Mini-Arcade - 
With one or more games (amount varies) where if x amount of points were gained the game would transition to another game. 
Will store high score points - Local Storage.
Save Avatar - Local Storage(Stretch goal).


2. Pain point - The paint point that this app would solve is entertainment. The boredom that the users using the app would be cured. The passing of time during long days would be easier to get through. Everyone needs a small win every day. It would be a great to use while waiting in Queue/Line at WalMart.

3. We need a main/landing page, high score page, "about me" page, one functioning arcade game, Sick Styling/Transitions.
